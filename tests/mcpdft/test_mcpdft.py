# Test API:
#   0. Initialize from mol, mf, and mc
#   1. kernel
#   2. optimize_mcscf_
#   3. compute_pdft_
#   4. energy_* 
#   5. get_energy_decomposition
#   6. checkpoint stuff
#   7. get_pdft_veff (maybe this elsewhere?)
# In the context of:
#   1. CASSCF, CASCI
#   2. Symmetry, with and without
#   3. State average, state average mix w/ different spin states
